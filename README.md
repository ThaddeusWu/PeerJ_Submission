# Supplementary Information : Code of EFSA algorithm

This code is uploaded for the submission of Non-linear Reverse-engineering Method for Inferring Genetic Regulatory Networks.

This is only included our written programs. For programs and data from other researchers, we give the links to get them.

Dynamic analysis of gene expression and genome-wide transcription factor binding during lineage specification of multipotent progenitors.Cell Stem Cell, 13(6):754–768.

Our written programs is based on the programs which are written by Junbai Wang in our previous paper (Wang, J., Wu, Q., Hu, X. T., and Tian, T. (2016). An integrated approach to infer dynamic protein-gene interactions, a case study of the human p53 protein.Methods, 110:3–13.)

See the uploaded files for our written programs and all other necessary function during the computation, please check the following reference: Junbai Wang (2020). MGraph (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/14635-mgraph), MATLAB Central File Exchange. Retrieved February 23, 2020. 

The following two written programs is modified based on the Forward Algorithm and it is used to predict the regulatory networks from non-linear terms to genes.
